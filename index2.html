        <p>Dear Devotees,
            In this issue, we take up the life story of Daivarata, the gifted Vedic scholar who spontaneously uttered eight Sanskrit stanzas upon his first meeting with Bhagavan at Skandasramam in 1917.
            We also look at the origins of the Tamil parayana in this first segment of a three-part series on its history.
            Continuing with Sadhu Natanananda’s Upadesa Ratnavali comprising 108 instructions in all, which Bhagavan corrected after its completion in 1931, in this issue we see the 11th stanza with Bhagavan’s correction. For videos, photos and other news of events, go to

                <h1>IN PROFILE</h1>
                <H2>DAIVARATA</H2>
                <P>Each one of Bhagavan’s devotees is unique and this also applies to Daivarata who first came to Bhagavan at Skandasramam in 1917 at the age of 25. Born in 1892 to a family of Vedic pundits from Gokarna, North Kanara District of the Bombay  Presidency, presently in Karnataka state, he grew up in an environment soaked in scripture and recitation. As a boy, he studied the Rigveda and Taittiriya under the guidance of his father, Vighneswara Bhat Bhadti, a Vedic scholar living  the simple life of a farmer. His mother, Smt. Nagaveni,  was the daughter of a learned scholar Sri Ganesa Sastry
                Hosamane and the family followed the tradition their ancestors had carried with them from North India some 800 years earlier when they were brought to South India by the renowned King Mayura Varma.1
                Named Ganesh after his maternal grandfather, the boy attended classes run by the local Vedic pundits but decided not to follow the priestly profession and instead, aim for higher spiritual ideals. At the age of fifteen he was initiated into bhakti yoga by Ramdas Maharaja of Ujjain who inspired him with devotion and taught him to relish the transformative power born of singing and dancing to classical devotional songs. Ganesh accompanied his teacher along with other disciples on a two-year pilgrimage that took them across the whole of North India and up into Nepal. When their yatra led them to the teacher’s native Ujjain, his beloved guru attained samadhi on the banks of the River Chambal.2
                On Ganesh’s return journey, he met Tembe Maharaj, the highly revered peripatetic saint monk who perpetually wandered all over India in the traditional way, granting blessing simply by his presence. Expert in Sanskrit, jyotisha and yoga, Tembe Maharaj was highly regarded for his saintliness and extraordinary spiritual attainments. He taught Ganesh pranayama and other traditional yogic practices. Later Ganesh met Kavya Kantha Ganapathi Muni when the Muni came to Gokarna to observe austerities. Ganesh was naturally attracted by the Muni’s charisma, ardent faith, and knowledge of the Vedas. In a short time, Ganesh became the teacher’s most coveted student and received the name ‘Daivarata’ after the ancient Rishi Devarata to whose pravara3 he belonged. The Muni initiated Daivarata into Upanishadic disciplines such as mukhyapranopasana and the vaidica vidya4. Over many months attending the Muni’s lectures, Daivarata picked up spoken Sanskrit.5 He renewed his study of the Gita and the Upanishad and in the
                PrMuni’s absence, studied the yoga-kriyas with Tembe Maharaj. Later he took to a life of penance, living on alms in a little hut on the banks of the Ganges. He lost interest in acquiring endless amounts of book knowledge. He went to Bombay where he stayed for some time and proceeded to Orissa to join the Muni. Once reunited, master and pupil set off for the Mahendra mountains where they observed penance for a month at the Parasuram Tapovana. Next, the master led him to Arunachala to meet and pay respects to his guru, Bhagavan Sri Ramana, where they would spend the next two months. At the first sight of the sage, Daivarata was so moved that verse began to spontaneously pour forth from his lips. He uttered eight Sanskrit stanzas which would later receive the title ‘Ramana Vibhaktyastaka.’6 The impact of the sage’s presence was so great that Daivarata felt he could grasp the Sage’s teaching without the least confusion just by listening with rapt attention. In speaking of Bhagavan after this first encounter, Daivarata reflected:
                On getting Maharshi’s darshan, all the doubts in one’s mind are cleared and one’s desire to know is also fulfilled all at once. This is a sign of his spiritual greatness. His eyes always glitter with spotless light, full of peace and pure love. To sit and gaze at his motionless, peaceful countenance is itself an act of worship. By having his divine darshan, people forget the world. They do not feel the pangs of hunger and thirst. Negative feelings or attitudes such as anger and hatred subside altogether. And people become so much engrossed in his darshan that they do not like to leave his divine presence.7
                In visits to the Ashram on the Hill, Daivarata could not help but be very impressed by the Maharshi’s continuous and ‘natural communion with God’. He set about to figure out how he might reach such a state.8 He writes:
                Bhagavan has reached the state which is beyond the four varnas and Asramas, and therefore, he is called athivarnashrami. He is firmly established in his Divine state keeping himself free of all thoughts desirable and undesirable, happy and unhappy. Great pundits, yogis, yatis, ascetics, mahatmas, rajas and maharajas are fascinated by his divine self-knowledge.9

                <p>Ramana Gita 
                    During an encounter with Bhagavan on 7th July 1917 at Skandasramam, Daivarata posed numerous questions. Ganapathi Muni had encouraged his disciples to clear their doubts with the Sage as he 
                    wanted to note down Bhagavan’s responses and include them in the volume of Sanskrit verse he was working on titled Ramana Gita. Daivarata, who 
                Bhagavan knew as ‘Gajanana,’ asked about correct conduct in this world of births and deaths and the 
                    means of attaining True Knowledge. As Bhagavan responded to each question, Kavya Kantha noted 
                    down the Master’s answers in ‘sutra form’ i.e. in brief aphoristic phrases, and then very soon rendered 
                    them into Sanskrit verse. Answers to Gajanana’s (i.e. Daivarata’s) questions were eventually incorporated 
                    into Sri Ramana Gita, Ch.III. The completed work was ready by the end of the year and was translated 
                    into Telugu and Tamil10 and published in 1923.Daivarata’s first question was: “In this samsara, what 
                    is the chief thing a sadhaka must do?”Maharshi: Well, your question is what you as a person should do in 
                    regard to your karma, action. It asks about the most important duty. You wish to arrange duties in the order of their importance, and this 
                    importance is based on the value—to you—of the fruits of each karma. In short, you are inquiring into your appropriate karma Translated by S. Narasimhayya, later known as Pranavananda.</p>
                <img src="C:\Users\Sakthi\Downloads\r3.jpg" alt="r3">
                <p> success is achieved. Even the mere Pranava Japa would suffice. You see that by such a japa (of either the Pranava or other mantras) the mind is deflected from its operations regarding the objective world. By identifying oneself with the mantra, one attains the Atman. Sri Arunchala Pancharatnam S. Narasimhayya (see footnote 10) was present 
                    during Daivarata and Ganapathi Muni’s visits up at Skandasramam in July and August 1917. He requested the Muni to compose a song on the guru which he did under the title Guru Gitam. Devotees then asked for benedictory verses at which point it was mentioned that Bhagavan had earlier composed a single Sanskrit verse, in arya metre, 
                    beginning with “karuna purna sudhabdhe”. Hearing this, Ganapathi Muni asked Bhagavan if he would be willing to compose four more verses which would, along with the first, form the five benedictory verses to the Guru Gitam. Bhagavan wrote the additional verses and Daivarata  penned a concluding verse. The five from Bhagavan and 
                    the final verse from Daivarata came to form the Sanskrit Arunachala Pancharatnam which was later translated into Tamil by Bhagavan. The Tamil version is still sung today 
                    as the concluding part to the Monday evening Tamil parayana. Daivarata’s verse reads:This is Sri Ramana Maharshi’s vision of Arunachala in the language of the Gods. It is a jewel of five verses in Arya meter, and indeed contains the essence of the Upanishads.Padaiveedu OutpouringsAfter two months with Bhagavan Ramana, the  Muni and his disciple went to Padaiveedu (between 
                    Tiruvannamalai and Vellore) to continue their sadhana. One day, Ganapathi Muni heard Daivarata muttering while in a deep state of meditation. When the same thing happened the following day, the Muni realized that the utterances were Vedic in nature and were in Vedic meters. Ganapathi Muni began taking notes. These 
                    daily occurrences lasted three hours and went on for about sixteen consecutive days. The verses are in four This prose version of Chapter 3 is from B.V. Narasimha Swa-
                    mi. For the complete text see <https://archive.arunachala.org/ newsletters/2009/sep-oct#ch.3>.The concluding verse beginning “srimad ramana maharsher” 
                    was written by Gajanana.Rendered in Parayana: The Poetic Works of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi as: This Arunachala Pancharatnam revealed by Sri Maharshiin Sanskrit is the very essence of the Upanishad. and the value of its fruits. Does not the karma and its importance depend plainly on the individual who is to perform it and reap 
                    the fruit? If so, then, as a preliminary to this investigation, first inquire who the person is that does the karma and tastes the fruit. In other words, take up the inquiry “Who am I?” and inquire 
                    into yourself, which almost immediately becomes the inquiry into the Self, with a view to gaining Self-knowledge.Gajanana: Again, Revered Sir, what are the means to attain this Self-realization, and as for the means already suggested, namely, inwardly directed inquiry (pratyagdrishti), how are we to attain it? Maharshi: The steps to attain Self-realization are these: First, the mind should be withdrawn from its objects, and the objective vision  of the world must cease. Secondly, the mind’s internal operations (such as ruminative thinking) must be put to an end. Thirdly, 
                    the mind must thereby be rendered characterless (nirupadhika or free of attributes) and must continue characterless; and lastly, it must rest in pure vichara, contemplation or realization of its nature. This is the means for pratyagdrishti or darsana, also termed antarmukham, the inward vision or inquiry.Gajanana: How long does one have to go on with his niyama 
                    (disciplines such as the regulation of food, sleep and exertion)? Is he to adhere to them till he attains Yoga Siddhi? And do they prove useful right up to the end?Maharshi: Yes, the spiritual aspirant in his ongoing pursuit of yoga is helped by such disciplines. Once he reaches his goal, disciplines drop away on their own.
                    Gajanana (adverting to the answer to his first question): Revered Sir, as for the goal that is attained by firm, characterless vichara mentioned just now, cannot the same goal be attained by the repetition of mantras?Maharshi: Yes, if the mantra japa is unbroken and performed with an undeflected current of attention and with due faith, equalVedic meters, namely, Gayatri, Anushtubh, Trishtubh and Jagati, and ‘invoked forty-two Vedic deities of  which Saraswati, identified with Vak, the Goddess of  Speech, was predominant.’14 The commentary adds that ‘none of these mantras were traceable to any known Vedic source.’ 
                    In his commentary, the Muni said that some of the mantras could not be noted down simply owing to the rapidity with which they were uttered. Others were not sufficiently distinct. Only those which were complete and clearly audible, and which could be taken down in full were compiled. Some fifty suktas (hymns) with 448 stanzas were noted. K. Natesan later commented on the humility of 
                    Ganapathi Muni who took the trouble to note down the utterances of his young student. But the Muni recognised the greatness of these verses that came forth spontaneously from his pupil’s lips in a recurring darshana 
                    of chandas, a vision of Vedic mantras. Natesan writes: The Guru of the disciple, our Ganapathi Muni, acted as scribe and noted down the mantras as they issued forth from his inspired disciple. Later, the Muni even wrote a commentary on the mantras just as Adi Sankara had done for the verses of his disciple Hastamalaka.The mantras were so remarkable that Ganapathi Muni used the word ‘supersight’16 to refer to his disciple’s enunciations which seemed to suggest inspired 
                    contact with the Goddess Vak. The commentary by These are the details of the event as presented in Chandodarśana by Daivarata (1968), a publication given to Mani Rao as a pdf file by Kapre. The book includes Daivarata’s verses and an introduc-tion and commentary by Ganapathi Muni.See <https://kavyakantha.arunachala.org>. Chandodarshana is mostly translated as a ‘vision of Vedic mantra’.</p>
                    <p>vGanapathi Muni includes Daivarata’s birth chart on which the Muni is well-qualified to comment given his formidable understanding of jyotisha. He comments  that the rasi contains combinations and alignments (yogas) that would suggest ‘greatness’.Later, when India’s first President, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, had serendipitously come across Daivarata’s notes in New 
                        Delhi, he was ‘so impressed by the scholarship evident in these fragments that he visited Gokarna and gradually became Daivarata’s supporter and follower.’ More interesting still is that there were subsequent initiatives in 
                        the Vedic world (though ultimately unsuccessful) to have the utterances included in the Atharva Veda.Bhagavan, the Mountaineer After the experiences at Padaiveedu some years passed 
                        until Daivarata saw Bhagavan again in the mid-1920s. Later during the Jayanti celebrations of 1936, GVS submitted his Telugu verse translations of Ramana Chatvarimsat (‘Forty Verses in Praise of Ramana’) and 
                        notes that he had already sent the Ashram a rendering of Ramana Vibhakti Ashtakam (“Eight Grammatical Cases in Praise of Ramana”) authored by Daivarata. While scrutinising the two works, Bhagavan said that Daivarata 
                        had originally described him in the first of his eight verses as a “Mountaineer” (Parvathiyah) whereas Nayana urged  him to change it to “the son of Parvathi” (Paarvatya:).Living Mantra: Mantra, Deity, and Visionary Experience Today,Mani Rao: <https://vdoc.pub/documents>. Ibid.
                        It is interesting to note that the first line in the published ver- sion retains parvatiyah or ‘mountaineer’ and reads, śrīmat parāśaroyam pramuditavadanah pāvanah pārvatīyah. For the full text, see <https://archive.arunachala.org/docs/ramana-vibhakti-ashtakam>.</p>

                    <p> Announcements: Upcoming Events in Delhi Sri Ramanasramam President, Dr. Venkat S. Ramanan will give a series of talks in Delhi during the first week of August. Two talks at an annual conference at Delhi IIT, one at the Delhi Ramana Kendra and on Friday the 4th August at 3pm, a talk at the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library entitled, ‘Contributions of Sri Ramana Maharshi to National 
                        Awakening and to India’s Spiritual Heritage.’ Lecture links at:<https://www.youtube.com/user/nehrumemoriallibrary>. Bhagavan also mentioned to those in the Hall that 
                        Daivarata was living in Nepal and was held in high esteem as “Maharshi Gajanan Sarma.” A visitor had recently asked Bhagavan where Daivarata was. Even as Bhagavan was replying that his whereabouts was not known, the day’s mail was handed to Bhagavan, and  the very first letter was from Maharshi Gajanan Sarma of Mukthi Kshetram, Nepal. In it he had written that though he was so far away, he always felt that he was only at the feet of Bhagavan. As if to bring home that feeling, the letter enclosed a photograph of Daivarata with a flowing beard. Bhagavan added that it struck 
                        him at the time as if Daivarata himself appeared in person and answered the query, saying “Here I am!” 20 . It was also in 1936 when Daivarata lost his two first gurus. Both Tembe Maharaj and Ganapathi Muni left the body that year. Daivarata had always been grateful to Ganapathi Muni for having brought him to Bhagavan. 
                        <img src="C:\Users\Sakthi\Downloads\r5.jpg "  alt="r5">
                        In August 1938 Daivarata met Gandhiji along with Dr. Rajendra Prasadji and Jamnalal Bajaj in Bombay and on Gandhji’s request, the three went to see Bhagavan to seek his blessings. Group photos were taken of the party and other devotees together with  Bhagavan behind the darshan hall.
                        Daivarata’s Visit in 1946 Daivarata next visited the Ashram in February 1946, still ‘looking sturdy and strong’. After parayana, Bhagavan recounted the history of Daivarata’s visits to Tiruvannamalai starting with Skandasramam in 1917.  At breakfast, Bhagavan enquired where Gajanana, i.e. Daivarata, was staying and what he was going to take. It was reported Gajanana had gone for his bath. Bhagavan then said, “He can eat anything. If you give him a quantity of tender neem leaves and a chembu of 
                        cow’s urine, he will breakfast on that. He had lived on  things like that [during his years of wandering].”About 10.30 a.m. Gajanana was in the hall showing a picture of a Pasupati image in Nepal and explaining its esoteric significance. Later that day, Gajanana was telling Bhagavan about Nepal. He said, among other things, ‘There are three important shrines in Nepal, all 
                        very sacred. The King is a very religious man, and it 20 G.V. Subbaramayya’s Reminiscences, p. 8.is the custom and tradition there for the King not to do anything or go anywhere without first going and  taking permission from the gods in these temples.’ 
                        Balaram Reddy said to Bhagavan, “He does bhajan  with great spirit and enthusiasm. We should have it one day here.” When asked, Gajanana expressed his  willingness. “Can we get some tinkling beads for the ankles and some accompaniment?” Bhagavan also said, “He must have some sruti like harmonium, some accompaniment like mridangam or ganjira and some cymbals (jalra).” Balaram Reddy asked if Gajanana had performed bhajans while walking on 
                        pradakshina. Bhagavan replied, “Oh, he would do his bhajan while walking. He would jump from one side of the pradakshina road to another. He was so full of life and enthusiasm.” Gajanana said, “I was much 
                        younger then. But I can do it even now.” Discussing where and when such a bhajan should be arranged, it was decided that it would be better in the dining hall.21 When all was arranged, Bhagavan sat where he 
                        usually did at mealtime while devotees all sat in rows.Daivarata began singing and dancing up and down the rows with great enthusiasm. He also sang Ganapathi Muni’s Chatvarimsat in his own melody, dancing to the tune.
                        Conclusion :After Bhagavan’s Mahanirvana, Daivarata built his own ashram near the seashore outside of Gokarna  and established a Veda patasala there with about 20 ,21 Day by Day 13-2-46 Morning.</p>
